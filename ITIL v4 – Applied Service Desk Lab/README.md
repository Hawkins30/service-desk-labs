# ITIL v4 – Applied Service Desk Lab

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate practical understanding of ITIL v4 concepts as they apply to a first-line IT service desk. Rather than focusing on theory, this lab applies ITIL practices directly to real service desk tickets using a ticketing system.

The lab shows how incidents and service requests are managed, prioritised, documented, resolved, and reviewed in line with ITIL best practices.

## Tasks Performed

### Incident Management
- Created multiple Incident tickets to represent service disruptions such as:
  - Email login failure
  - Slow computer performance
  - VPN connectivity issues
- Classified issues correctly as Incidents due to impact on service availability.
- Assigned tickets based on ownership and priority.
- Added internal notes documenting diagnosis and ITIL-based reasoning.
- Communicated progress and resolution to users via public replies.
- Resolved incidents to restore normal service as quickly as possible.

### Request Fulfilment
- Created Service Request tickets for standard user requests including:
  - Additional monitor request
  - Access to shared HR folder
  - Microsoft Teams installation
- Classified tickets correctly as Service Requests rather than Incidents.
- Documented handling and approval steps using internal notes.
- Communicated outcomes clearly to users.
- Closed requests once fulfilment actions were completed or scheduled.

### Priority, Impact and Urgency
- Applied ITIL principles to assign priority based on impact and urgency.
- Identified single-user issues as medium or low priority.
- Ensured Incidents were handled before Service Requests.
- Demonstrated awareness of service level expectations without over-configuring automation.

## Why This Lab Matters
ITIL principles underpin most IT support and service desk environments. This lab demonstrates the ability to apply ITIL concepts in a practical, job-relevant way rather than relying on theory alone.

The skills demonstrated in this lab are directly applicable to first-line and junior IT support roles.
